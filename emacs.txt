Setup the project:
      Move to the root directory of the project using "cd" command.
      Save "init.el" available in the 'resources' directory to the projects root directory.
      Launch emacs from bash using the command
      	     "emacs -q -l init.el ."
	     
This will create the tags for all the .c and .h file present inside the root directory recursively.
Load the TAGS table for use.
You can use the following command to update the tags while working on your project:

M-x update-tags
    - This will update (recreate and load table of) TAGS based on the current state of the code.
